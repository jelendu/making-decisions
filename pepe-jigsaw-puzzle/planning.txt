Directory
server.js: server setup
controller.js: handles HTTP requests

Reason for some of the code I use:
- cors() is a middleware where I can legally request resources or libraries from an established website as long as it is for developmental purposes only
- app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, ''))): this tells express.js to use its middleware(express.static) to serve static files from the same directory its running on


Database:
When a user plays a game, theres a new entry in the Leaderboard table. If they're a guest, the temp_id is used from their local storage. If they're a registered user, their user_id is used.


Puzzlers table 
- user_id: A unique identifier for each user.
- player: The player's name.
- username: The player's chosen username.


Leaderboard table 
- leaderboard_id: A unique identifier for each entry which is usually set as an auto-incrementing primary key in SQL databases. This means that every time a new record is inserted, the database automatically assigns the next available integer to the leaderboard_id field. 
- score: The player's score.
- time_taken: The time it took the player to finish the game.
- user_id: The ID of the user who achieved this score. NULL for guests?
- temp_id: The temporary ID of the guest who achieved this score. NULL for registered users?
